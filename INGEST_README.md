# Ingest Chase Statement Text â†’ Dashboard

This script ingests a `pdftotext -raw` file (with our Chase markers) and appends
transactions to the correct year tab in your Dashboard, rebuilds summaries,
and formats dates as `yyyy/mm/dd`.

## Install

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install pandas openpyxl
Usage
powershell
Copy code
# Example for Novâ€“Dec 2018 statement
python ingest_statement_text.py --input 20181206.raw.txt --dashboard Chase_Budget_Dashboard.xlsx --rules category_rules.csv
How it decides the year
It pulls the year from the filename (e.g., 20181206.raw.txt â†’ 2018).

For December statements that include November dates, it still assigns those lines to 2018 (per your preference).

What it extracts
Everything between *start*checks paid and *end*electronic withdrawal:

Checks Paid

ATM & Debit Card Withdrawals

Electronic Withdrawals

Skips headers and lines like Total ... Withdrawals.

Category rules (optional)
Provide a category_rules.csv with columns:

keyword

category

match_type (contains|startswith|regex)

case_sensitive (0|1)

Rules are applied first; if no rule matches, the script uses sensible defaults.

De-duplication
Dedupe key is (Date, Description, Amount) so re-running the same file won't double-count.

Output
Appends to the proper year sheet (e.g., 2018).

Rebuilds Monthly Summary, Yearly Summary, YOY Comparison.

Leaves your workbook saved in place.

ðŸ‘‰ Save that into a file called `INGEST_README.md`.  
- If you open it in **Notepad**, it will look like plain text.  
- If you open it in **VS Code** or on **GitHub**, it will render with nice formatting.  

Do you want me to also give you a **plain `.txt` version** of the README so you donâ€™t have to deal with Markdown at all?
